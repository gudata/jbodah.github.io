It's been a bit shy of a year since I've moved to Vim from Sublime.
Here are some of my thoughts since my transition:

## The Good

### Very portable

### Highly extensible

### Very good (but not complete) built-in help

## The Bad

### High learning curve

One of the hardest things about switching to vim is the steep, never ending learning curve.
It takes a lot of practice and memory to get over old habits, but once you've gotten
used to things like moving with `hjkl` you don't want to go back.

### Lots of rough edges

Even after being settled in my general workflow for a bit there are still a few rough
edges. For example, I still need to tweak my color schemes and hide some infromation
that I don't need from my status bars. My `:Gem` function still needs some work as I'm
having trouble integrating it with [CtrlP](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim)
and [Ag](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim). I also occassionally run into issues with
[NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) and some of my custom chords. It gets
a little frustrating to have ***yet another*** set of bugs to resolve.

### Lots of configuration

My [.vimrc](https://github.com/jbodah/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc) is 200+ lines now.
My tmux configs are getting pretty big and complex too. While I remember what almost
all of it does, it does need a good scrubbing to remove old stuff. I'm constantly
tweaking my snipmate snippets. I still have to figure out how to deal with language-specific
configurations. There's a lot of overhead to running a vim workflow, and I'm not
sure I'd recommend vim due to the huge configuration effort.

### Vimscript is a must

### Find/replace over many files

## My Favorite Vim Features

### `h` `j` `k` `l`

### `C-u` `C-d`

### `A` `I` `O` `o`
### Snipmate

### `f` `F` `;`

### `.`

### `/` `?`

### `,pry`
