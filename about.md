My name is Josh Bodah. I've been working as a web developer for four years.
In that time I've used Ruby, Javascript, and C# professionally.
I've also used many more both academically and in my spare time including C, C++, Java, Python, IO, Go, Scheme, and Clojure.

Feel free to checkout some of my open source projects such as [spy_rb](https://github.com/jbodah/spy_rb), [gemmy](https://github.com/jbodah/gemmy_rb),
and several others on [my Github](https://github.com/jbodah)
